<h2 style="color: navy; font-size: 24px;">Hello and welcome to my academic homepage!</h2>
<p style="font-size: 18px;">My name is Xinhao Pan and I am currently a third-year graduate student at Beijing Normal University studying natural resources in the Faculty of Geographical Sciences. My current research focuses on urban expansion modeling, deep learning, and remote sensing. I am also very interested in topics such as water scarcity, climate change, land system science, ecosystem services, natural resource management, and sustainable development.</p>
<p style="font-size: 18px;">Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me and my academic background. Please feel free to explore my research and publications further on this site.</p>
